# SharkRadar
**Sharkradar** is a lightweight, yet flexible **service registry and discovery** tool, compatible with any microservice *(independent of tech stack)*, as long as your microservice supports **HTTP** for communication (generally, it surely would, unless you have some custom protocol for communication. In that case, *Congratulations* !)

## Architecture
The architecture of sharkradar is pretty straight forward, keeping in mind:

 - Usability
 - Compatibility
 - Lightweight
 - Low storage footprint
 - Low computational footprint
